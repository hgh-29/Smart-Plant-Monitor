Smart Plant Monitor Overview: 
The Smart Plant Monitor is a simple, portable device that helps keep plants healthy by monitoring soil moisture and sunlight levels. It uses sensors to collect environmental data and provides real-time feedback through an RGB LED. A rotary encoder allows users to adjust settings, such as the moisture threshold for watering alerts. The goal of this project is to make plant care easier and more reliable.

Features
Soil Moisture Sensor – Detects when the soil is too dry.
Light Sensor (LDR) – Measures the intensity of sunlight reaching the plant.
RGB LED – Displays visual status feedback (e.g., green = good, red = dry, blue = low light).
Rotary Encoder – Allows the user to adjust moisture sensitivity or other settings.
Microcontroller (Arduino) – Processes input from sensors and controls the LED output.
Portable Power – Battery-powered design makes it easy to move between plants.
