# ðŸŒ± Smart Plant Monitor

## Overview
The **Smart Plant Monitor** is a simple, portable device that helps keep plants healthy by monitoring soil moisture and sunlight levels. It uses sensors to collect environmental data and provides real-time feedback through an **RGB LED**. A **rotary encoder** allows users to adjust settings, such as the moisture threshold for watering alerts. The goal of this project is to make plant care easier and more reliable.

## Features
- **Soil Moisture Sensor** â€“ Detects when the soil is too dry.  
- **Light Sensor (LDR)** â€“ Measures the intensity of sunlight reaching the plant.  
- **RGB LED** â€“ Displays visual status feedback (e.g., green = good, red = dry, blue = low light).  
- **Rotary Encoder** â€“ Allows the user to adjust moisture sensitivity or other settings.  
- **Microcontroller (Arduino)** â€“ Processes input from sensors and controls the LED output.  
- **Portable Power** â€“ Battery-powered design makes it easy to move between plants.
