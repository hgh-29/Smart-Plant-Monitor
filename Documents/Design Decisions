# ðŸŒ± Smart Plant Monitor Overview

The objective of the **Smart Plant Health Monitor** is to provide plant owners with a simple and reliable way to track the overall well-being of their plants. The device measures key environmental factors, including **soil moisture**, **soil temperature**, **ambient temperature**, **humidity**, and **light levels**, providing users with a comprehensive understanding of the conditions that impact plant health.

To make the data easy to understand, the monitor uses an **RGB LED indicator** to communicate status at a glance.  

- LED off: all conditions within optimal ranges (plant healthy)  
- LED red: temperature too high  
- LED blue: temperature too low  
- LED yellow: soil moisture below threshold  
- LED orange: plant needs more sunlight  
- Multiple conditions: LED flashes corresponding colors in sequence  

The smart monitor is powered by a **rechargeable battery with integrated solar charging**, allowing extended outdoor operation with minimal user intervention.
